# Terraform-Jenkins
This is test project to create the vpshere VM using the terraform. Since terraform engine doesn't comes with GUI on opensource variant , will be using jenkins pipeline to call the terraform binary to plan and apply the job. 
I have included terraform pipeline file also in this reposiroty. 

This is the test update to validate GitHub Desktop!!!
